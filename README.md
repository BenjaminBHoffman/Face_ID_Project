# FaceIDProject
This project uses computer vision software to identify a person based on very little amounts of data in a low-level application. 

## Installation
To begin the installation, go to a code editor of your choice and clone this repository with the URL "https://github.com/BenjaminBHoffman/Face_ID_Project". Ensure you have Python downloaded and installed on your device. Create a new virtual environment to run the Python code in. Next, to ensure the virtual environment can run scripts, run PowerShell as Administrator and enter the command "Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted". A prompt will come up warning you that changing your execution policy might expose you to malicious scripts, but don't worry, we'll change this right back after activating our virtual environment. Type "Y" to the prompt, then go back to your code editor and type ".venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1" to activate the virtual environment. Once activated, you should see a green '(.venv)' text before your command line. Go back to your Administrator PowerShell window and type "Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted" then "Y" to set your execution policy back to what it was. You may now close that PowerShell window. Next, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the virtual environment terminal to install all the dependencies for the code.

##License and Code-of-Conduct
For our code of conduct and our license, we decided to go with 2 pre-existing ones because we wanted a very basic and standard code of conduct and license and neither of us has ever written a legal document before, so it made the most sense to use a free standard code of conduct and license from online.
